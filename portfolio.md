## Robust Control for Low-Mass Quadrotors under Wind Disturbances

This project focused on developing and evaluating robust control strategies for quadrotors operating under wind disturbances, using the Crazyflie 2.0 platform. The drone was modeled with cascaded dynamics, decoupling attitude and position control. Three control algorithms were implemented: Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID), Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), and Sliding Mode Control (SMC). The project followed a simulation-to-hardware pipeline to design, test, and deploy these controllers.

### Key Contributions:
1. **Simulation-to-Hardware Pipeline:**  
   The controllers were first tested in a ROS2 and Gazebo simulation environment with wind modeling. This pipeline facilitated the transition to hardware, allowing for iterative tuning and real-world validation.  

2. **Drone Modeling with Cascaded Dynamics:**  
   The quadrotor was modeled with cascaded dynamics, which decoupled attitude control (roll, pitch, yaw) from position control. This approach simplified the design of control algorithms and enhanced stability under disturbances.

3. **Controller Designs:**  
   - **PID:** Provided a simple yet effective baseline for trajectory tracking and hover stability.  
   - **LQR:** Demonstrated exceptional robustness to wind disturbances but sacrificed some position accuracy.  
   - **SMC:** Showed high disturbance rejection capabilities but required extensive tuning to minimize chattering effects.

4. **Hardware Implementation:**  
   The Crazyflie quadrotor's firmware was modified to integrate the custom controllers, enabling dynamic selection of PID, LQR, and SMC during flight without reflashing.  

5. **Wind Testing and Real-World Evaluation:**  
   - In simulated and real-world tests, LQR excelled in orientation stability, while PID maintained moderate accuracy in trajectory tracking.  
   - SMC handled extreme disturbances effectively but struggled with trajectory tracking due to chattering.  

6. **Practical Insights:**  
   - The study highlights the trade-offs between controller robustness and precision.  
   - The simulation-to-hardware pipeline proved essential for bridging the sim-to-real gap, accounting for unmodeled dynamics and hardware constraints.

This work demonstrated the feasibility of deploying advanced controllers on low-cost drones, showcasing applications in dynamic environments such as search-and-rescue and industrial inspections.

## RL for Autonomous Humanoid Bi-Manipulation

### Internship Summer 2024

During my internship at Boardwalk Robotics Inc., I worked on developing a reinforcement learning (RL) pipeline for bi-manual manipulation tasks. This involved using the Sake Hands manipulators on the upper body of their humanoid robot, Alex. My primary focus was enabling Alex to pick up a book lying flat on a table.

The simulation environment for this project was built using NVIDIA's Isaac Sim, where I implemented the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, adapted from the SKRL library. My work included defining coordinate frames, applying domain randomization to enhance generalization, and tuning hyperparameters for the policy and value networks. I also designed reward functions, termination conditions, and unit tests to ensure the pipelineâ€™s reliability and effectiveness.

<small> Isaac Sim training environment </small>

One of the key aspects of this project was designing a curriculum that incrementally increased task complexity. To facilitate learning for more challenging tasks, I pre-trained the networks on simpler objectives before gradually introducing harder goals. This approach enabled efficient learning and established a flexible simulation baseline capable of generalizing to objects of different shapes and sizes.

The pipeline has significant potential for sim-to-real transfer, enabling skills learned in simulation to be applied in real-world scenarios. This work lays the groundwork for Alex to perform similar pick-and-place tasks in practical applications.

As an initial project, I trained a Franka Emika Panda arm to open a drawer and move it aside. While a smaller part of my contributions, this task helped me gain familiarity with the tools and techniques necessary for handling more complex tasks with Alex.

This experience enhanced my skills in reinforcement learning, robotics, and algorithm tuning while demonstrating the potential of simulation frameworks to address real-world robotic manipulation challenges.

#### Key Components:
1. **Sound Source Detection:** Detects and localizes sound sources, providing positional data for navigation.

## Design of a Controller for a Buck-Boost Converter
### Course Project: Lab design and practical realization of a voltage converter 
This project focused on designing and implementing controllers for a buck-boost converter, a critical component in power electronics used to efficiently adjust voltage levels. The primary goal was to ensure stable and regulated output voltage despite changes in input voltage or load conditions.
A buck-boost converter without a controller relies entirely on the duty cycle of its switching circuit, making it highly sensitive to variations in operating conditions. Such systems often suffer from significant voltage ripple, slow transient responses, and potential instability, limiting their effectiveness in practical applications.

To address these issues, I began by mathematically modeling the converter to understand its ideal and real-world behaviors. These models were validated through simulations in LTspice, helping refine the design and predict performance.
#### Controller Design
1. **Digital Controller:** Implemented on an Arduino using a PI control algorithm. This controller dynamically adjusted the duty cycle, significantly improving voltage stability and reducing ripple.
2. **Analog Controller:** Designed using operational amplifiers, it included:
   - **Differential Amplifier:** To calculate the error signal between the desired (set) voltage and the measured output voltage.
   - **Inverting Amplifier:** Used for proportional control, scaling the error signal by the proportional gain.
   - **Integrator Circuit:** Designed for integral control to eliminate steady-state error, implemented using an inverting integrator configuration.
   - **Summing Amplifier:** Combined the outputs of the proportional and integral stages to produce the final controller signal.
#### PWM Generator Circuit  
A PWM generator circuit was designed to translate the controller output into a pulse-width-modulated signal. This circuit used a sawtooth waveform generator, built with a NE555 timer IC, and a comparator circuit based on an LM393 IC. The sawtooth signal was compared to the controller output to generate a precise PWM signal, which was then fed into the buck-boost converter for control.
#### Handling Parasitic Capacitances  
Parasitic capacitances in the comparator circuit and other parts of the PWM generator were mitigated by careful component selection and design. A pull-up resistor was added to stabilize the comparator output, and the rise and fall times of the PWM signal were optimized by considering the effects of parasitics. Additionally, decoupling capacitors were placed near power pins of ICs to reduce noise and stabilize the operation.
#### Testing and Results  
Noise filters were incorporated to reduce output voltage ripple further. The system was tested extensively under varying load conditions and input voltages. The controlled system demonstrated:
- Stable output voltage regulation.
- Improved transient response to load changes.
- Reduced ripple compared to the uncontrolled system.
- Higher efficiency with the analog controller.
