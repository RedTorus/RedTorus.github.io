## Ongoing Research
## Robomechanics Lab Carnegie Mellon University

I am currently exploring the integration of **loco-manipulation capabilities** onto the **Ghost Robotics Spirit 40** quadruped robot within the **Quad SDK framework**. This research involves augmenting the quadruped robot with a gripper mechanism in place of its head. 

### Objectives:
- Enable the robot to perform **manipulation tasks** while maintaining its locomotion capabilities.
- Develop control algorithms to synchronize movement and manipulation for efficient operation in complex environments.

### Progress:
1. **Global Body Planner Adjustments**:
   - Implemented the ability to **reuse sampled maps** using Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM).
   - Enhanced dynamic obstacle handling through **lazy PRM** techniques.
   - Extended planning to incorporate movements in the **z-axis**.

2. **Next Steps**:
   - Create basic motion plans to reach objects.
   - Develop grasp planning capabilities for effective manipulation.

This ongoing work aims to push the boundaries of quadrupedal robot functionality, combining robust locomotion with precise manipulation capabilities to address a variety of challenges.
